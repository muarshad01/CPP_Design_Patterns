\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_observer}{Observer} Design Pattern

Intent\+: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they\textquotesingle{}re observing.

Note that there\textquotesingle{}s a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated with this pattern. Just remember that the \doxylink{class_subject}{Subject} is also called the Publisher and the \doxylink{class_observer}{Observer} is often called the Subscriber and vice versa. Also the verbs "{}observe"{}, "{}listen"{} or "{}track"{} usually mean the same thing. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
