\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The \doxylink{class_flyweight}{Flyweight} stores a common portion of the state (also called intrinsic state) that belongs to multiple real business entities. The \doxylink{class_flyweight}{Flyweight} accepts the rest of the state (extrinsic state, unique for each entity) via its method parameters.
